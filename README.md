### Public API request -- Random User

An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, to share employees contact information with each other.

This app uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

It requests a JSON object from the API and parsse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
